# Python Execution Prototypes

This repository contains prototypes of different Python execution environments
for use in the browser. This repository was created to evaluate whether these
would be suitable to replace Skulpt which is currently used by the
[editor-ui](https://github.com/raspberryPiFoundation/editor-ui) project.
